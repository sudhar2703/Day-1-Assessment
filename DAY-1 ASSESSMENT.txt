1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP1.1:
             (i).Send multiple request and response in multiple connection.
             (ii).It loads the resources one by one, if one resource fails it won't load the upcoming resources.
             (iii).No priorities in loading.
             (iv).server push is not possible.
HTTP2:
              (i).Send multiple request and response in single connection.
             (ii).Send multiple streams of data at once so there won't be any blockage of resources.
             (iii).Priorities in loading.
             (iv).server push is possible.
      
2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
        (i).Objects are important data types in javascript and are different than number, string and boolean.
        (ii).Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of (Key: value pair).
        (iii).These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods.
        (iv).Every object has some property associated with some value. 

Example:
var selva = {
(object is created)
selva.age = 25; (property of an object with values)

selva.degree = 'b.tech';

selva.branch = 'Mechanical';

selva.cgpa = 7.95;
}

After creating selva object, the value inside the object (selva) can be accessed using keys.

selva.age

Output: 25
